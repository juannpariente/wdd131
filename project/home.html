                <p>A graphics card, also known as a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), is a vital component responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations on your computer screen. It processes complex graphical data and ensures smooth visuals, making it essential for gaming, video editing, 3D modeling, and other graphic-intensive tasks. High-performance GPUs can significantly enhance your computer's visual capabilities and overall experience.</p>

                <p>The processor, or Central Processing Unit (CPU), is often called the brain of the computer. It carries out instructions from software and hardware, performing calculations and managing data flow. The CPU's speed and number of cores directly impact how efficiently your computer runs applications and handles multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>

                <p>The motherboard is the central circuit board that connects and allows communication between all the components of your computer, such as the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripherals. It provides the necessary slots and ports for hardware installation and serves as the backbone of your system, ensuring all parts work seamlessly together.</p>

                <p>RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of volatile memory that temporarily stores data your computer actively uses. It plays a crucial role in system performance by enabling quick access to applications and files currently in use. More RAM allows for better multitasking and faster execution of programs, improving overall computing speed.</p>
